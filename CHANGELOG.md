# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

- `render()` returns `paths` (path data per layer), `width` and `height`, and
  every sheet has `paths`, so host apps can draw layers without parsing SVG.
  Each layer path has `d` (everything), `regions` (closed outlines, filled
  even-odd on fill layers) and `lines` (open lines, always stroked).
- `margin` render option and `--margin` flag: space between the parts and
  the sheet edge, separate from `gap` between parts (defaults to `gap`).
- Errors from a missing font carry `missingFonts`, so a host can load the
  fonts and render again.
- `parameters()` gives list settings `"type": "number"` with a list
  `initial`, the same as OpenSCAD's parameter JSON (was `"vector"`).
- Every setting has `span`, the source offsets of its value, so an editor
  can change the value without touching anything else.
- A setting's caption comes only from a comment on its own line above it,
  not from the end-of-line comment of the setting before.
- `text_width()` and `text_metrics()` errors report their line and column.
